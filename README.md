# O365 Administration Center

v0.0.6

Please note some screenshots below may not be up to date. I will try to keep the main one (o365 GUI) up to date

The o365 Admin Center is a GUI application that administrators can use to perform some of the most common o365 tasks. The output (error or success) is sent to the textbox which also acts as a input for custom commands. You can also save the output to a file. You just need the .exe to run the application and it does not need to be installed. The code is written in PowerShell.
