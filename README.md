# O365 Administration Center

v0.0.6

The O365 Admin Center is a GUI application that administrators can use to perform some of the most common O365 tasks. The output (error or success) is sent to the textbox which also acts as a input for custom commands. You can also save the output to a file. You just need the .exe to run the application and it does not need to be installed. The code is written in PowerShell.
